#summary Draft for centralized login service using login.python.org as an example
#labels UserStory,TheFlow,Concept

== Introduction ==

Quoting issue #7, it is very annoying to have numerous logins for various [http://python.org python.org] sites:

*sites that require user login*
 * wiki
   * main: http://wiki.python.org/moin/
   * jython: http://wiki.python.org/jython/
 * pypi: http://pypi.python.org
 * bug trackers
   * main: http://bugs.python.org
   * meta: http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/meta/
   * setuptools: http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/
   * pypi: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=66150&atid=513503
 * mailing list subscription management
 * mailman private archives
   * http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/pydotorg/
   * http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/soc2010-mentors/

*web pages* (that would be nice to see [ModerationQueue#Corrections_for_Python_site_documentation editable from web])
 * http://python.org
 * http://docs.python.org

In addition many python.org sites don't have valid *SSL/TLS certificate* for secure authentication that protects users against man-in-the-middle attacks.

== Other examples ==

It is also very annoying to have multiple logins for PySide (Qt) development sites:

 * wiki: http://qt-project.org/wiki/
 * bug tracker: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/
 * code reviews: https://codereview.qt-project.org/
