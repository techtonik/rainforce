### Make your project accessible ###

  * [ ] Create a Google Group for feedback and code reviews
    * [ ] Enable code highlighting in Group Settings. Information -> Web view customization
    * [ ] Ensure that group members can post by checking Permissions -> Basic permissions
      * (this was the source of at least [one epic fail](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rainforce/I96rpZ2Jl84/discussion))
    * [ ] Check Posting permissions there
      * [ ] Ability to attach files can be useful for screenshots
    * [ ] Access permissions may allow members to see each other
    * [ ] Set Settings -> Email options -> Display the URL of the posted message.
      * (convenient when you want to read/reply from the web)

> <a href='Hidden comment: group and not mailing list, because
1. user will need yet another password / annoying registration
2. not everybody wants to subscribe
3. lists usually don"t have convenient search and web archives
'></a>

  * Administer -> Source
    * [ ] Enable code reviews
    * [ ] Redirect code reviews to your Group address
<a href='Hidden comment: 
people need to ask question about your code
'></a>

  * Administer -> Issues
    * [ ] Tune columns in issue tracker
    * [ ] Check "Non-members can set labels when creating issues"

### Make it interesting ###

  * [ ] Make sure there is a clear answer "what your project does?"

  * [ ] Document your architecture, see examples:
    * http://mediagoblin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devel/codebase.html

  * [ ] Write progress reports if you can. They are most interesting for returning users. For example, see [UFO:AI](http://ufoai.org/wiki/News) and [FreedroidRPG](http://www.freedroid.org/news/)

### Make it inclusive ###

  * [ ] Add a label for issues what current project members are unlikely to take - HelpNeeded, Priority-No, Priority-Low, whatever
  * [ ] Add Easy label for issues that total beginners can help with ([OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/) project aggregates such tasks across different projects)

### Make it visible ###

  * [ ] [Add +1 button](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rainforce/WblQP9_HyK8) to Google Code project page and wiki pages by inserting `<g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>` string.
    *
