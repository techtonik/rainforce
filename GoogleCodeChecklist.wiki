#labels Featured

=== Make your project accessible ===

 * [ ] Create a Google Group for feedback and code reviews
   * [ ] Enable code highlighting in Group Settings. Information -> Web view customization
   * [ ] Ensure that group members can post by checking Permissions -> Basic permissions
     * (this was the source of at least [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rainforce/I96rpZ2Jl84/discussion one epic fail])
   * [ ] Check Posting permissions there
     * [ ] Ability to attach files can be useful for screenshots
   * [ ] Access permissions may allow members to see each other
   * [ ] Set Settings -> Email options -> Display the URL of the posted message.
     * (convenient when you want to read/reply from the web)

   <wiki:comment>group and not mailing list, because
   1. user will need yet another password / annoying registration
   2. not everybody wants to subscribe
   3. lists usually don't have convenient search and web archives
   </wiki:comment>

 * Administer -> Source
   * [ ] Enable code reviews
   * [ ] Redirect code reviews to your Group address
<wiki:comment>
people need to ask question about your code
</wiki:comment>

 * Administer -> Issues
   * [ ] Tune columns in issue tracker
   * [ ] Check "Non-members can set labels when creating issues"

=== Make it interesting ===

 * [ ] Make sure there is a clear answer "what your project does?"

 * [ ] Document your architecture, see examples:
   * http://mediagoblin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/devel/codebase.html

=== Be inclusive ===

 * [ ] Add a label for issues what current project members are unlikely to take - HelpNeeded, Priority-No, whatever
 * [ ] Add Easy tasks to tracker for beginners
