#summary Best practices for projects hosted on Google Code

=== Make your project accessible ===

 * [ ] Create a Google Group for feedback and code reviews
<wiki:comment>not mailing list, because
1. user will need yet another password / annoying registration
2. not everybody wants to subscribe
3. lists usually don't have convenient search and web archives

 * [ ] Enable code reviews in `Administer -> Source` and redirect them to your Group address
<wiki:comment>
people need to ask question about your code
</wiki:comment>

 * [ ] Tune columns in issue tracker

=== Make it interesting ===

 * [ ] Make sure there is a clear answer "what your project does?"

 * [ ] Document your architecture, see examples:
