**rainforce** is an attempt for a joint initiative to foster collaboration and save precious time in software development by removing roadblocks, improving tools and ways that lives easier by automating as much as possible and helping others do the same.

**rainforce** it a philosophy that creating inspiring environment for contributions is important, that having fun is essential, and that commit privileges are not required to make something you like even better. it is also about making things last longer, about sustainability, incremental development and autonomous existence, about ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.

> _alone waterdrop falls from the sky and vanishes unnoticed. it may not worth much, but joining others in a small stream it becomes a river that brings impossible things to the ocean of reality._

**rainforce goal** is to extract maximum from every little contribution, not to develop a ready to use product, but to enhance other software contributing to things touched on the way. life is short, so it is better to focus on things that are _easy to learn_, _easy to improve_ and _easy to maintain_.
