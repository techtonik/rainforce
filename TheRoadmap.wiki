The goal of bootstrap activity is to provide an easy and fast entrypoint to run open-source projects from source, and to start with development (i.e. fixing bugs) as soon as possible.

 * (Planning) [http://wiki.python.org/moin/TrackerDevelopment bugs.python.org ] using [https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/devinabox/ dev-in-a-box] port

 * ([https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/trac-bootstrap-script/src Frozen]) Trac
    * Hard dependency on setuptools ([http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/10419 can't be helped])

{{{
# creates project in spyder/ directory, needs mercurial, needs python
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/ spyder
cd spyder
python bootstrap.py
}}}

== Workflow ==
