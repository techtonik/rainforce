#summary RVA - Rainforce Visualization API
#labels Speccy

Version 0.1

== The name of this speccy ==

No API is perfect, and so this one. To distinguish this Visualization API from others it could be referenced as `rainforce visualization api` or RVA for short.

== RVA Level 0 ==

Apps supporting this level receive input from stdin. That's it.

Example:
{{{
    $ runtests | visuapp
}}}
The command redirects output from some `runtests` command to some `visuapp` visualizer. It is the role of visualizer to understand if the data makes sense and represent the data.

Level 0 doesn't specify how visualizer should react if the data doesn't make any sense. But visualizer MAY return code 220 if it failed to parse the input. Ideally `visuapp` could forward non-zero return codes from the process it is connected to through the pipe, but I doubt that's possible.
