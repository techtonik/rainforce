=== Logging (2.x tested, 3.x unknown) ===

To make `logging` module more easy to use, e.g.
{{{
import logging

logging.error('SNAFU')
}}}
it makes an automatic configuration when any top level functions like logging.error() are called. More specifically, it implicitly calls `basicConfig()` which is a one-shot function that can be called only once.

As a result, if imported modules are using logging in simplified mode, you have to keep in mind different things about `basicConfig()` that are better to live without.

*recommendation* (ideal case) - Start with study of several use case scenarios:
 # basic 'logging' usage - 'import logging; logging.log()'
 # advanced usage - all imported modules are using 'import logging; logging.log()'
 # more advanced example - mixed usage of named and unnamed loggers in imported modules and root app
